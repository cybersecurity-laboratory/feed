# what's this?
This is an IoCs that has been molded to be easily incorporated into Netwitness Feeds and Lists.
The latest list contains the latest IOC at the moment. The old emotet may not be covered, but the query is simplified so you can get the most out of Netwitness.
The composit list summarizes the IOCs identified so far. This is covered wide detection range but an error occurs in some operations of Netwitness, because too mane long query.

Thanks to @cryptolaemus1 for providing the original IoC.
